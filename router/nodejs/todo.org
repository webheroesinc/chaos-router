* To-do

** Chaosrouter errors
   Errors within chaosrouter should always be caught and handled

** Chaosrouter Core context
   Make sure the context has the correct methods when running directives, and when calling sub
   methods

** Params were not URI decoded
   Make sure that params are being URI decoded

** Defer called wrong resolve, reject
   Make sure defer doesn't call the wrong resolve, reject methods

** Restructuring object arguments
   The Restruct API should be re-designed so that an object will remain untouched if there are no
   Restruct commands in it.

** Populater templates
   Make templates usable in other templates

** Populater methods
   Be able to pass functions with names so you don't have to specify the name

** Chaosrouter Core rules
   Parent rules are only run if there is a rules config in the Draft.  Parent rules should always
   be run!
